# Desktop Setup Scripts

This script basically setups everything I would do in a new installation, automation is key in productivity :relieved:

Blogpost comming up later ...

The project folders;

+ dotfiles, just look around inside there; Beware stealing won't help :smirk:
+ images (Background and Screen saver) :grin:
+ wg folder :unamused:

## Included `scripts/`
* `dotfiles.sh` sets up all my dotfiles, for `vim`, `tmux`, `bash`, `OMZ` and `etc`
* `wg.sh` sets up wireguard config.. well not needed really but doesn't harm if it still stays there
* `desktop.sh` sets up my desktop enviroment look and feel, this includes icons, images and both folders and folder bookmarks
* `software.sh` installs all my common softwares, it's a long list so don't mind me :bowtie:
* `setup.sh` this brings all the scripts together, and does some finishing touches.
* `sync.sh` sync's my dotfiles to my git repo folder, to commit any changes.
